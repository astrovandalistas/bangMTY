This is Python code written to run on a RaspberryPi and control v2.0 of the Arma Sonora Telematica. It's a simple state machine that gets tweets with a specific hashtag and controls a motor and some lights through relays connected to the GPIO pins.

Dependencies:
- python-rpi.gpio (sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio)
- wxPython (sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8 python-wxtools)
- pygame (sudo apt-get install python-pygame)
